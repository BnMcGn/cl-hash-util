cl-hash-util is a very basic library for dealing with CL's hash tables. The
idea was spawned through working with enough JSON APIs and config files,
causing a lot of headaches in the process. For instance, to get a value deep
within a hash, you have to do:
  (gethash "city" (gethash "location" (gethash "user" obj)))

With cl-hash-util, you can write:
  (hash-get obj ("user" "location" "city"))

hash-get can also deal with getting elements out of lists and arrays:
  (hash-get obj ("user" "friends" 0 "name"))

which normally would have to be written as such:
  (gethash "name" (elt (gethash "friends" (gethash "user" obj)) 0))

...uuuugly.

cl-hash-util also provides an easy way to build hash tables on the fly. 
Where you'd normally have to do something like:
  (let ((myhash (make-hash-table :test #'equal)))
    (setf (gethash "name" myhash) "andrew")
    (setf (gethash "location" myhash) "santa cruz")
    myhash)

You can now do:
  (hash ("name" "andrew") ("location" "santa cruz"))

You can also do nested hashes:
  (hash ("name" "andrew")
        ("location" (hash ("city" "santa cruz")
                          ("state" "CA"))))

This saves a lot of typing =].
